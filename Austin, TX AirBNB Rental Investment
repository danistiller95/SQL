--In this analysis I used AirBNB data from Inside AirBNB to explore the idea of buying a AirBNB property in Austin, TX.

--How many AirBNB rentals are in Austin, TX?
SELECT 
COUNT(id) AS rentals_in_Austin
FROM BIT_DB.AIRBNB_listings;

--What is the average cost per night?
SELECT 
AVG(price) AS Average_Price_Per_Night
FROM BIT_DB.AIRBNB_listings;

-- Are private rooms or entire homes/apartments more popular?
SELECT
room_type,
COUNT(room_type) AS total_room_type_listings
FROM BIT_DB.AIRBNB_listings
GROUP BY room_type
ORDER BY total_room_type_listings DESC;

-- What are the top 5 neighborhoods??
SELECT 
neighbourhood,
COUNT(neighbourhood) AS total_neighbourhood_listings
FROM BIT_DB.AIRBNB_listings
GROUP BY neighbourhood
ORDER BY total_neighbourhood_listings DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- What is the average minimum stay requirement?
SELECT 
AVG(minimum_nights) AS average
FROM BIT_DB.AIRBNB_listings;

-- What are the average amount of bookings for the next 365 days?
SELECT
365 - AVG(availability_365) AS average_bookings
FROM BIT_DB.AIRBNB_listings;

-- What is the average yearly revenue potential?
SELECT 
(365 - AVG(availability_365) ) * AVG(price) AS average_yearly_revenue_potential
FROM BIT_DB.AIRBNB_listings;

-- How many rentals does each host have?
SELECT 
host_id,
host_name,
COUNT(host_id) AS num_of_rentals
FROM BIT_DB.AIRBNB_listings
GROUP BY host_id
ORDER BY num_of_rentals DESC;

--Which listings are over the average price per night with less than half a year of availability?
SELECT
name,
availability_365,
price
FROM BIT_DB.AIRBNB_listings
WHERE availability_365 < (SELECT AVG(availability_365) FROM BIT_DB.AIRBNB_listings) 
AND price > (SELECT AVG(price) FROM BIT_DB.AIRBNB_listings) 
ORDER BY availability_365 desc;

--Which listings are under the average price per night with more than half a year of availability?
SELECT
name,
availability_365,
price
FROM BIT_DB.AIRBNB_listings
WHERE availability_365 > (SELECT AVG(availability_365) FROM BIT_DB.AIRBNB_listings) 
AND price < (SELECT AVG(price) FROM BIT_DB.AIRBNB_listings) 
ORDER BY availability_365 desc;

--Based on the average home price in Austin being $600,000, the estimated yearly mortgage would be $46,265.40. This is well below the average yearly revenue potential 
determined in this analysis. Factors that were not availabile to analyze in this data are the added costs of property management, cleaning services, and lawn care. 
These could also affect potential earnings. Another limitation of this anaysis is the availability data. Multiple listings show "0" availability in the next 365 days, 
but it does not specify if this is due to the listing being booked for that time or unavailable. Based on my analysis, I would look into added costs of buying a AirBNB 
before making any purchases.
